Trustlines relay server
=======================
The Trustlines relay server is a component of the `Trustlines Protocol <https://trustlines.foundation/protocol.html>`__.

The goal of the relay server is to handle computation and services which are currently not feasible to do on the client
or on the blockchain.

Documentation can be found at `https://dev.trustlines.network/relay/introduction <https://dev.trustlines.network/relay/introduction>`__.
