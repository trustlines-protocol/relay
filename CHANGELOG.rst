`unreleased`_
-------------------------------

`0.18.0`_ (2020-09-14)
-------------------------------
- Fixed: error handling for firebase when client token is not found

`0.17.1`_ (2020-09-08)
-------------------------------
- Added: `TrustlineRequestCancel` push notification support

`0.17.0`_ (2020-09-03)
-------------------------------
- Fixed: Wrong firebase error handling for invalid client token
- Added: `PaymentRequestDecline` push notification support

`0.16.0`_ (2020-08-27)
-------------------------------
- Change firebase push notifications to data push notifications
- Remove :code:`event_query_timeout` from relay config as it is not used anymore (BREAKING)
- Add endpoint to get paid delegation fees via tx hash: :code:`GET /delegation-fees?transactionHash=hash`
  this endpoint returns a list of all delegations fees paid within the transaction with given hash
- Add :code:`extraData` to response of endpoint :code:`GET /transfers?options...`
  which returns a list of information for identifies transfer
- No longer watch address file for new currency networks, exchange, unwEth, identity proxy factory addresses
- Deprecate config `relay.update_indexed_networks_interval`: it is no longer used and should be removed
- Fix logging of unknown events with warning `MismatchedABIy`
- Added: `identityImplementation` field to response of endpoint about identity information `api/v1/identities`


`0.15.0`_ (2020-04-21)
-------------------------------
- Add endpoint to get all events of a trustline: :code:`/networks/<network_address>/users/<user_address>/trustlines/<counter_party_address>/events`
- Add `logIndex` and `blockHash` to events returned from endpoints
- Add endpoint :code:`GET /transfers?options...` to get a list of information for transfers either via enveloping tx hash, or via the transfer
  event or via a related balance update event identified via block hash and log index.
- Add endpoint to get list of all trustlines in a currency network :code:`GET /networks/:networkAddress/trustlines`
- Change config of relay to enforce having no :code:`currency_network` if delegation fees are set to :code:`{'base_fee'=0, 'gas_price'=0}`. (BREAKING)
- Change config so that if no accepted fees are specified, no fees will be accepted, i.e. the delegate will not pay for meta-tx. (BREAKING)
- Change: Delegate will now check the value of `feeRecipient` for meta-tx, it has to be the delegate's address or the zero_address to be correct.
  The zero address is only for backwards compatibility and will be removed in the future. (BREAKING)
- Change: No longer use the pending block to get events, the graph is now updated on the latest block instead. (BREAKING)
- Deprecate :code:`transactionId` in events for :code:`transactionHash`. It will be removed in future versions.
- Deprecate return of currency network address if delegation fees are 0. In the future it will return :code:`null`.
- Deprecate undocumented field address returned when querying trustlines information (for a user, for a network, in between users of a network,
  for a user in a network). If you were using it, change to counterParty. Will be removed in future release.


`0.14.0`_ (2020-03-02)
-------------------------------
- Add endpoint to ask for transaction status
- Add endpoint to ask for meta-transaction status
- Improve performance of log listener by reducing the number of registered log listeners in the blockchain node.
  This should reduce cpu usage of the relay.
- Improve performance of user-events endpoint (:code:`users/<>/events`). THis should reduce the number of connections to the
  sql db and improve the response time.
- Remove :code:`__class__` field in events. This field was not meant to be there.


`0.13.1`_ (2020-02-28)
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: Set delegate gas price also for identity deployments

`0.13.0`_ (2020-02-27)
-------------------------------
- Improve performance of :code:`/networks` endpoint
- Allow delegate to set a gas price strategy in config. Supported are rpc (ask node via rpc), fixed (use a fixed gas price and bound (ask node, but set min/max limits)
- Allow to set connection method to node in config. Websockets and IPC were added to the already supported http method
- Docker: Expose relay default rest port

`0.12.1`_ (2020-02-23)
-------------------------------
- Fix delegate functionality with no unlocked account

`0.12.0`_ (2020-02-19)
-------------------------------
- Add config to enable/disable features of the relay server
- Change config schema, the old Schema does still work but is marked as deprecated and will be removed in future versions
- Change: Push notification will not mark messages as read, so there are still available to be retrieved later
- Change endpoint for getting balance to return wei instead of eth (BREAKING)
- Change meta-transaction schema to match new features in the contracts. (BREAKING) New fields: chainId, version, baseFee, gasPrice, gasLimit, feeRecipient, timeLimit, operationType. Fields removed: delegationFees, extraData
- Remove data content of push notification (BREAKING)
- Improve error messages of meta transaction related endpoints

`0.11.1`_ (2020-01-17)
-------------------------------

`0.11.0`_ (2020-01-15)
-------------------------------

-------------------------------
- Add make logging configurable via the TOML configuration file
- Remove gas estimation on find path requests (BREAKING)
- Change: deploy identity requests are only allowed for known identity factories (BREAKING)

`0.9.0`_ (2019-10-05)
-------------------------------
* Change identities endpoint to deploy identity contracts with deterministic addresses via a factory contract
* Change identities endpoint to deploy identity contracts as proxies to an implementation contract. Reduces the gas cost of deployment
* Change the arguments of identities endpoint (BREAKING)
* Increase debug output for push notifications

`0.8.1`_ (2019-10-03)

* Add an option to set the gasprice calculation method. This is necessary if the rpc endpoint by parity is too slow.

`0.6.0`_ (2019-03-14)
-------------------------------
* Allow find_path to search for paths for receiver pays transfers
* Fixed a bug, where the time being slighly off resulted in an internal server error

`0.4.1`_ (2019-01-25)
-------------------------------
* fix broken dependency on old version of trustlines-contracts-bin

`0.4.0`_ (2019-01-24)
-------------------------------
* new endpoint for trustline closing has been added, the reduce debt endpoint
  has been removed
* the used contracts package has been upgraded
* the internal path finding and fee computation has been enhanced to support
  payments without fees for the last hop
* a payment method, where the receiver pays fees, has been added
* max capacity path calculation has been fixed
* tl-relay now parses command line arguments

`0.3.0`_ (2018-11-16)
-------------------------------
* web3 has been upgraded from 3.16.5 to 4.7.1. As a result you should be able to
  install py-eth-index and trustlines-watch into the same virtualenv.
  Also `THREADING_BACKEND` doesn't have to be set anymore.
* `ETHINDEX` doesn't have to be set anymore. The relay server uses the ethindex
  backend by default.
* A gevent aware wrapper of pytest has been added. Please run `./pytest` inside
  the relay repository now.
* The spendable endpoints have been removed::

    /networks/<address:network_address>/users/<address:a_address>/spendable
    /networks/<address:network_address>/users/<address:a_address>/spendables/<address:b_address>

* The nonce is queried from the pending transaction. This will allow multiple
  transactions per block. Please make sure to start parity with the
  `--jsonrpc-apis=all` or `--jsonrpc-apis=parity` option.
* The docker image is now based on ubuntu 18.04 and python 3.6
* Add option to syncronize the sending of transactions if env TRUSTLINES_SYNC_TX_RELAY
  is set, because of a bug in parity
* Require python version >= 3.6
* Add interests:
  The returned balances include an estimation of the interests
  Can work with Trustline Updates that include interests
  Breaks backwardscompatibilty, will not work anymore with old contracts without interests
* Add first version of endpoint to find a path to close a trustline via a rebalancing of the
  trustlines.

`0.2.0`_ (2018-08-21)
-------------------------------
* trustlines-relay has been released on PyPi
* the dependency on trustlines-contracts has been replaced with a dependency on
  trustlines-contracts-bin. trustlines-contracts-bin contains only the compiled
  contracts. The installation has become easier, since populus and solc isn't
  required anymore. Therefore tl-deploy isn't being installed anymore.
